# afterburner.fx

The opinionated just-enough [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter) framework (2.5 classes) for JavaFX.
This variant offers a more fluent API and more features.

Afterburner is a "Just-Enough-Framework" extracted from [airhacks-control](https://github.com/AdamBien/airhacks-control) and used in [airpad](https://github.com/AdamBien/airpad), [lightfish](https://github.com/AdamBien/lightfish) and [floyd](https://github.com/AdamBien/floyd) applications.

Goal: "Less Code, Increased Productivity"
